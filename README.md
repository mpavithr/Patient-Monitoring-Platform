# Patient-Monitoring-Platform

The following readme contains information about this project and the branching strategy.

## Repository Setup

### Requirements

This repository uses python3+.

Make sure to install the requirements:

```
python -m pip install requirements
```

## Development

When working on the patient monitoring platform, an issue will be opened with the desciption of the task being done. Work will be done in sprints in a different branch with respect to `main` (Branching strategy is furthur explained in wiki). Sprint tasks have to pass unit testing by sprint deadline. Once thoroughly tested, code goes into `main` branch which means it is ready for release. Sprint tasks not completed by the sprint deadline are moved to the next sprint. 

## Branching Strategy

## Testing

All implementations should have unit tests written to verify their implementation. Any testing file should have the prefix "test_". This repository uses `pytest` as its test runner. 

As of 13th March 2022, Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 are complete.
