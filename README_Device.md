The main branch as of 2/13/2022 fulfills phase 0 of project.
The Device branch as of 2/13/2022 fulfills phase 1 of project.

In this branch there are 3 files:

entering_in_shell.py - when running this file, users will be able to enter in their user information, device information and measurements through the command line creating a shell for the device interface.

The file will then use the information recieved through the command line and put the information into tables according to the schemata in main branch thus creating a device interface.

So there will be an entry in a user table, device table, and measurement table every time the file is run.

Tables will be for now python dictionaries for each user, each device and each measurement.

Unit Testing involves testing whether the information provided by a user is valid for the field.

User dictionary will contain dictionaries of all users.
Device dictionary will contain dictionaries of all devices.
Measurement dictionary will contain measurements of all measurements.
